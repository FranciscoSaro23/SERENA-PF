PROBLEMAS:

âœ– Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Errors validating asset fields in /home/expo/workingdir/build/SERENA/app.json:
 Field: icon - image should be square, but the file at './assets/icon.png' has dimensions 2000x2092.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

âœ– Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-font
Required by: @expo/vector-icons
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-font"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

âœ– Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android. 
Advice:
Add '/android' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

âœ– Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-splash-screen
  Unmaintained: react-native-splash-screen
  No metadata available: lucide-react, react-native-color-picker, react-native-color-picker-wheel, react-native-websocket
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
